🏠 House Price Prediction Project
This project aims to predict house prices based on various features such as lot area, building type, year built, and more. The dataset provided contains information about different houses, including their characteristics and sale prices. The goal is to analyze the data, build a predictive model, and visualize the results.

📌 Project Overview

The House Price Prediction project involves analyzing a dataset to understand the factors that influence house prices. We will perform data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, and build a machine learning model to predict house prices. Finally, we will visualize the results using Tableau.

📊 Dataset Description

The dataset contains the following columns:

🔑 Id: Unique identifier for each house.

🏠 MSSubClass: The building class.

🏙️ MSZoning: The general zoning classification.

🌳 LotArea: Lot size in square feet.

🛠️ LotConfig: Lot configuration.

🏚️ BldgType: Type of dwelling.

⭐ OverallCond: Overall condition rating.

📅 YearBuilt: Original construction date.

🔄 YearRemodAdd: Remodel date.

🧱 Exterior1st: Exterior covering on house.

🏗️ BsmtFinSF2: Type 2 finished square feet.

📐 TotalBsmtSF: Total square feet of basement area.

💰 SalePrice: The property's sale price in dollars.

🔄 Project Steps

1. Data Preprocessing

📥 Load the Dataset: Load the dataset into a pandas DataFrame.

❌ Handle Missing Values: Check for missing values and handle them appropriately.

🧹 Data Cleaning: Remove any unnecessary columns or rows.

🔧 Feature Engineering: Create new features if necessary.

2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

📊 Descriptive Statistics: Calculate basic statistics for the dataset.

🔍 Data Visualization: Create visualizations to understand the distribution of data and relationships between features.

🔗 Correlation Analysis: Analyze the correlation between features and the target variable (SalePrice).

3. Model Building

✂️ Split the Data: Split the dataset into training and testing sets.

🔍 Feature Selection: Select the most relevant features for the model.

🤖 Model Selection: Choose a machine learning model (e.g., Linear Regression, Random Forest).

🎯 Model Training: Train the model on the training data.

📊 Model Evaluation: Evaluate the model's performance on the test data using metrics like RMSE, MAE, and R-squared.

4. Visualization in Tableau

📊 Create Dashboards: Use Tableau to create interactive dashboards that visualize the data and model predictions.

🔍 Share Insights: Share insights and findings from the analysis.
